# AnnoQ Gene IDs Comparison 

The following code was designed to be run using input from [AnnoQ](annoq.org), which compiles results 
from [ANNOVAR](annovar.openbioinformatics.org/en/latest/), [SnpEff](pcingola.github.io/SnpEff/), and 
[VEP](uswest.ensembl.org/index.html).

The goal of this project is to compare Gene IDs assigned by the different annotation tools to the same 
SNP in order to inform the end users of any potential mismatch information.
